# hello-world
repository for github tutorial

This is a readme file for learning how to finally use Github.  Hopefully, this will help witht the 10,000,000 versions of code that I have to sort through between all of my MS and PhD ISE and DSA students!  


Not sure about any of this.

So, I'm evaluating the fork and pull model now.
